UbiquoActivity
==============

This plugin provides the capability to record information about actions executed in ubiquo.

It stores default fields (controller, action, ubiquo_user...) and can store additional information too.
By default, it's integrated with ubiquo_scaffold to work automatically for 'create', 'update' and 'destroy' actions.
