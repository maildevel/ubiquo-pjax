UbiquoAuthentication
====================

This plugin adds basic support for users in ubiquo. This includes the following features:

* Visual interface to create or edit users,

* User notifications/confirmations on creation
* Reset form for forgotten passwords
* "Superadmin mode" with a separate interface

You can also use the ubiquo:create_user task to create them easily from the console.
