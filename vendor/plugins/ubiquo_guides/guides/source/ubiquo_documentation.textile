h2. Ubiquo to update ubiquo guides and rdocs

The ubiquo project publishes 2 types of documentation for every plugin:

 * guides. Provide motivation and intented usage description of the plugin.
 * rdocs. Provide a reference for developers using ubiquo as their framework.

We need to maintain and publish different versions for, at least, each
minor version and the edge version. At the time of this writing:

 * edge
 * 0.7-stable

endprologue.

h3. Updating the guides

First we need to select which version we want to update. Let's say we
are updating the 0.7-stable version but the process to update edge
would be similar.

<shell>
ubiquo --edge --complete myapp
</shell>

At this point we can do our changes in the ubiquo_guides plugin source if needed,
but we are assuming modifications have already been commited and
pushed over a time period and now we are just publishing the changes.

And now, assuming you have the right privileges, we publish the guides
to the server using the appropiate rake task:

<shell>
rake ubiquo:guides:publish_edge
</shell>

This task will generate the guides and upload them to the server.

NOTE: The task would be ubiquo:guides:publish_07stable for the current stable version.

h3. Updating the ubiquo plugin rdocs

As with the guides we first create a fresh ubiquo project. Let's say
we are updating rdocs for the 0.7-stable version:

<shell>
ubiquo --stable --complete myapp
</shell>

Since rdoc templates are generated using "hanna":http://github.com/mislav/hanna as a template we need
to make sure we have the gem installed.

<shell>
rake ubiquo:rdocs
</shell>

Now we need to publish the generated ubiquo plugins rdocs to the
server using a rake task:

<shell>
rake ubiquo:rdocs:publish_07stable
</shell>

NOTE: The task would be ubiquo:rdocs:publish_edge for the edge version.

h3. Final words

We should update documentation as soon as we commit changes, if
appropiate, to avoid having outdated or innacurate information in the documentation.

The process it's a bit tedious and cumbersome feel free to improve it.
