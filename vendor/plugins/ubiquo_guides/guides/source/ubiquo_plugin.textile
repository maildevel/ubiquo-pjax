h3. Understanding your plugin

This section will explain what should you add in each generated folder, and what it will accomplish in your final app:

* app: This folder contains all models, controllers, views and helpers that will be acceed from your application but will live in plugin.
* config: In this folder you will add, commonly, your plugin locales, your plugin routes and any config file that is not an initialization of your code
* lib: This folder will contain all lib files needed by your plugin,
 including extensions, connectors...
* test: All unit, functional and integration test will be placed here
* rails: There is a file under this folder called init.rb, where all
 initializations needed for the given plugin should be placed
* install: This folder will contain all files that need to be
 installed under application tree. Then, the hierachy defined here
 will be the same followed when all files became installed
