UbiquoI18n
==========

This plugin adds i18n support to Ubiquo

This plugin is not about the ubiquo interface, which also comes with out of the box i18n capabilites (using the Rails i18n system). This is about translating data from models.

It tries to be simple to use, but also is filled with a lot of useful features, among which:

    * Define which attributes in a model are translatable with a single line.
    * Every translation is a separate instance, so you can operate on it transparently, as you did before ubiquo_i18n
    * Automatic update of shared attributes among translations
    * Define relations that should be shared between translations, ubiquo_i18n will track them for you
    * Use instance.translate(‘locale’) to create a translation of an existing model instance
