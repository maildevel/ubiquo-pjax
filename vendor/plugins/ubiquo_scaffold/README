UbiquoScaffold
==============

This plugin provides scaffolds to easily create parts of the application that take advantage of the Ubiquo features. Currently, this plugin features two different scaffolds:

= ubiquo_model

Stubs out a new model. Similar to rails' "model" scaffold, but adds a searcher function to the model to be easily connected with Ubiquo filters.

= ubiquo_scaffold

Creates code to handle resources on an application. This is the counterpart of rails' builtin "scaffold". It creates an ubiquo_model, route, ubiquo controller and views.

Example
=======

As an example, let's create a scaffold for a _Book_ model:

  script/generate ubiquo_scaffold book title:string published_at:datetime author_id:integer
  rake db:migrate

REST resources for this model will be created automatically. Check it out:

  map.namespace :ubiquo do |ubiquo|
     ubiquo.resources :books
     ...
  end

Therefore, you can now go to ubiquo/books and start managing books through this new Ubiquo section.
