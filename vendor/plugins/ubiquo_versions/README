UbiquoVersions
==============

This plugin adds versioning support to ubiquo

This means the capability to record the state of an instance before any change in its attributes, 
to be able to show a history or to revert to a previous version.

Some of the main features of this versioning implementation are:

    * Single table for model

Instead of having another table to store the old versions for each model, we store all the required information in the same model table.
This approach leads to bigger tables, but also provides the simplicity to treat every version as a model instance.

    * Explicit versioning

Since versioning itâ€™s usually a feature that is used only in determinated circumstances (e.g. when restoring an old version of something), the system is built in a way that using versions is explicit, and if no versioning info is used e.g. in searches, we get the normal, unversioned behaviour.

Example
=======

The easiest way to create a versionable model is to use the --versionable option when scaffolding. This will create an ubiquo scaffold with all the necessary changes the model and migration
